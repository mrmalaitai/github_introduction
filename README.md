Visual Studio Code and Git have to both be installed on your device before you follow the **instructions**.
You can watch [this tutorial]() on how to download and install both programs.

You will be asked which folder to clone your repository to. Choose a folder where you will be able to work from.<br>
:exclamation: You have just created a **local repository** from your **remote repository**.

**2. Changes inside your local repository**.<br>
You can now make changes to your repository. Changes include adding files, deleting files, and modifying files.<br>
Create a file named *testing.txt*.<br>
Type your *name* and *date* inside the texting.txt file.<br>

**3. Stage changes.**<br>
Once changes have been made, you **stage** them to prepare them to **commit** to your remote repository.
To stage the changes, go to **Source Control** on the left.<br>
![alt text](https://github.com/mrmalaitai/github_introduction/blob/master/images/04.PNG "Screenshot of source control")<br>
Hover over **Changes** and click the "**+**" icon to **Stage All Changes**.<br>

**4. Commit to remote repository.**<br>
Next you will need to add a message explaning the changes.<br>
*e.g. Added testing.txt file*<br>
![alt text](https://github.com/mrmalaitai/github_introduction/blob/master/images/05.PNG "Screenshot of message for commit")<br>
Press **Enter**.<br>
:exclamation: Everytime you make significant changes, **always** stage the changes and commit.<br>

**5. Push your local repository to your remote repository.**
After you have made your changes and commited them, you can now **push** your local repository to your remote repository.<br>
To push your repository, press **Ctrl + Shift + P**, type **git push**, and then hit **Enter**.<br>


**6. Check GitHub**<br>
If there are no problems, everything should be pushed. Check your remote repository on GitHub and see if all the files are there.
