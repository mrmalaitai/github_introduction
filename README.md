You will be using the following programs for Computer Studies:<br>

Visual Studio Code and Git have to both be installed on your device before you follow the **instructions**.
You can watch [this tutorial]() on how to download and install both programs.

# Instructions:

You will be asked which folder to clone your repository to. Choose a folder where you will be able to work from.<br>
:exclamation: You have just created a **local repository** from your **remote repository**.

**2. Changes inside your local repository**.<br>
You can now make changes to your repository. Changes include adding files, deleting files, and modifying files.<br>
Create a file named *testing.txt*.<br>
Type your *name* and *date* inside the texting.txt file.<br>

**3. Stage changes.**<br>
Once changes have been made, you **stage** them to prepare them to **commit** to your remote repository.
To stage the changes, go to **Source Control** on the left.<br>
